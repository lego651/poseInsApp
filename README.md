> We(team up with my girlfriend) are building an AI powered App that turns anybody into an excellent photographer immediately.

# Preface

### Background
My girlfriend and I have visited more than ten cities in last year and we just figured out there aren’t many photos we feel proud of sharing with family and friends. I know it is because I am a bad photographer, but I am learning to be good at photography. In the meantime, we think there should be an App that helps a boyfriend take great picture of his girlfriend.

We have got our motivation, and we decide to build something together.

### Our Experience
I am a front end developer working in San Francisco bay area and her job is to manage education programs. Apparently, I will get my hands dirty over those coding stuff and my girlfriend will take care of nice UI/UX.

### Product
The final product we image should be an app integrated within a drone. When you want to take a picture of you two during a trip, you can just let the drone fly away and this app will take good quality pictures for you automatically. It is just like you have hired a photographer.

Some features:
* It creates nice photography composition and highlight you
* You are free to move and make creative poses. It can judge what is an excellent pose and shoot that moment for you
* It takes hundreds of pictures but only renders top qualified pictures to you

### Be More Realistic
I know, I know… We should start with an MVP(minimum viable product). Don’t even think about AI photographer assistant, I will be that photographer. So this App should teach me how to take nice pictures of my girlfriend. After arguing with my girlfriend for two days, we decide to build something like this:
1. My girlfriend finds a nice scene she wants to take a picture with. We open this App and take picture of this nice scene first.
2. With this scenic picture, this App recommends five(or more) similar high quality pictures. You can choose how many people you want in the picture. It could be one female / male model, a couple, or a group of a family. It recommends high quality pictures based on what you choose(for MVP version, we decide to focus on recommending one female model by default).
3. Let’s say my girlfriend likes picture 1. I set picture 1 as a demo, and I just need to follow the demo to shoot a picture of my girlfriend. She can do the same pose like the model, or she can pose whatever she wants. Good point is this demo pictures let me know what kind of angle should I use, which location my girlfriend should be at in the picture, and what kind of feel she likes.
4. Follow demo picture to take a shoot. Done.

### Example
1.My girlfriend wants to take a picture at this wharf. So we simply take a rough picture of this scene.

2.Based on above picture, this App gives five recommendations.

3.My girlfriend likes the feeling of first picture. So we pick the first picture, and this App takes it as a template/demo picture. I just need to follow this demo and take a similar high quality picture like below:

### Plan
We don’t want to rush on this project, and we take it as a side co-working fun project. If we feel right this week, we will probably work for 40 hours a week. If we feel lazy, we will maybe contribute 4 hours a week. Also, we don’t know too much about machine learning, AI, deep learning… It is a good practice for us to learn and apply some AI techniques.

### Breakdown
To deliver a final product, there seems to be a few challenges to do accomplish step by step:
* Define problem and solution. Market research.
* Build picture recommendation system on server side
* Build a simple web version product to demonstrate product idea and validate this solution.
* Build a mobile App version.
